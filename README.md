# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## Overview
This project involves implementing and evaluating various classification methods on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes. Our goal was to compare the performance of different classifiers and gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Classification Methods
We investigated the following classifiers:
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks (MLP and CNN)

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with code implementations.
  - `CIFAR-10_logistic_Classifier_Implementation.ipynb`
  - `CIFAR-10_Neural_Network.ipynb`
  - `CIFAR-10_Random_Forest.ipynb`
  - `CIFAR-10_report.ipynb`
- **results/**: Contains graphs and results generated from the models.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CIFAR-10-Image-Classification.git
   cd CIFAR-10-Image-Classification
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to see the implementation of each classifier and the corresponding results.
